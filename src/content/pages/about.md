## The person

Hi there. My name is Chris Fung. "Fung" rhymes with "rung"; "Chris" is pronounced the usual way.

I'm also generally known around the internet as `aergonaut`. The `e` is or is not silent, reader's choice. Ages ago, when I was looking for a username, I wanted something that was

1. Visually appealing, since I would be seeing it a lot
2. Rare enough that I could reasonably expect it to always be available

"Airgonaut" was on a list of rare words in English, and I really liked it. I don't remember the definition exactly; it was something like "balloonist". It had a retro-future vibe that I found appealing. I swapped the spelling to make it a little more mysterious, _et voilà_.

I have been making websites and writing code almost since I first got to use a computer. My first website was a fan site for Pokémon Yellow that I made in 5th grade in my school's computer lab. The first programming language I used was BASIC, which I learned at summer camp; I thought it was a weird choice that I had to number the lines myself.

I have been working with software and the Web for over a decade. I want to find ways that I can use my skills and my code to build things that help others make more good in the world. I think being able to draw a (mostly) straight line between the code I write and tangible impact on users' work, or lives, is the most rewarding part about programming for me.

## The website

**aergonomicon** is my personal blog about code and technology.

It's gone through multiple iterations over the years, but the version you're reading now is built with Astro and deployed on Netlify. The content itself is authored in Obsidian.
